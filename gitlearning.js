// By default the git creates the main branch as master using "git branch -m main" command we can change the name of the main branch as per your choice.

// git status
// By using "git status" command we can check the git branches status including main branch name

// git status -s
// By using "git status -s" command we can check the git branches status

// git add gitlearning.html
// By default all the files in git branch is untracted so we have to use "git add" to file in staging area
// git add gitlearning.html git.js.
// This command add multiple files in staging area
// git add.
// This command add all files to staging area

// git commit -m "This is Initial Commit"
// By using "git commit -m" command we can commit the files in staging area with a message decribing the changes done by us.

// git config --global --list
// By using "git config --global --list" command we can check the global git configuration details.

// git log
// Displays the commit history with detailed information.

// git log --oneline
// Shows a compact commit history with one commit per line.

// git log --oneline --graph
// Displays a visual representation of the commit history in a concise format.

// git log --oneline --graph --all
// Shows the commit history for all branches, including the current branch.

// git checkout c50cc28
// Switches to the commit with hash c50cc28(This is simple Commit ID that we have to use to switch between 2 commits), updating the working directory to that state.

// git checkout main(Main is the name of main/master branch)
// Switches to the main branch (older method, still works)

// git switch main(Main is the name of main/master branch)
// Switches to the main branch (recommended for newer Git versions)

// git restore --staged gitlearning.css
// Removes gitlearning.css from the staging area without discarding changes.(This Command should be used in combination with below command)

// git restore gitlearning.css
// Restores gitlearning.css to its last committed state, undoing uncommitted changes.

// git reset HEAD gitlearning.css
// Unstages gitlearning.css moving it from the staging area back to the working directory.(This Command should be used in combination with below command)

// git checkout -- gitlearning.css
// Restores gitlearning.css to its last committed state, discarding uncommitted changes.

// git branch
// "git branch" lists, creates, renames, and deletes branches, helping manage parallel development in a Git repository

// git branch about
// The command git branch about attempts to create a new branch named about. If a branch with that name already exists, it does nothing.

// git log â€“all
// "git log --all" displays the commit history of all branches, including those not currently checked out

// git log --all --oneline
// This command lists the commit history of all branches in a concise, single-line format.

// git log --all --oneline --graph
// This command shows the commit history of all branches in a compact, one-line format with an ASCII graph representing branch structures.

// git commit --amend -m "This is 2nd Commit in About Branch"
// This command modifies the most recent commit by replacing its message with "This is 2nd Commit in About Branch", without changing its content.

// git push --force
// Overwrites the remote branch with the amended commit, Use only if the commit has already been pushed, as force-pushing can rewrite history and affect collaborators(Inorder to change commited message before or after pushing we need to use it in combination with above command)

// git branch --delete contact
// This command deletes the local branch named contact, but only if it has been fully merged into the current branch.

// git branch -D contact
// This command forcefully deletes the local branch named contact, even if it has unmerged changes, potentially leading to data loss.

// git merge contact
// This command merges the contact branch into the current branch, combining changes from both branches. If conflicts exist, Git will prompt for resolution before completing the merge.(Please note me have to give merge message with this command on editor)

// git merge contact -m "Merging contact branch into main"
// This command merges the contact branch into the current branch while providing a custom commit message instead of opening the default editor.

// git remote show origin
// This command displays detailed information about the origin remote, including its URL, fetch and push URLs, tracking branches, and the latest fetch status.

// git remote add origin https://github.com/ankit5599singh/Git-Learning.git
// This Command adds a remote named origin and links it to the specified GitHub repository, allowing you to push and pull code from it.

// git push -u origin main
// This command pushes the main branch to the origin remote and sets it as the upstream branch, allowing future git push and git pull commands to be used without specifying origin main.

// git push
// This command uploads the committed changes from the current branch to its associated upstream remote branch

// git clone https://github.com/ankit5599singh/Git-Learning.git
// This command creates a local copy of the remote repository, downloading all files, commit history, and branches from GitHub.

// git fetch
// This command retrieves the latest changes from the remote repository without merging them into the local branch, allowing you to review updates before integrating them.

// git merge origin/main
// This command merges the latest changes from the remote main branch (fetched using git fetch) into your current local branch.

// git pull
// This command fetches the latest changes from the remote repository and automatically merges them into the current local branch(This command is combo of fetch + merge)

// git reset 3923211
// This command moves the current branch to commit 3923211, unstaging all changes from later commits but keeping them in the working directory for modification. This is the default reset mode(Don't use this command if commit is pushed on GitHub)

// git reset --hard 3923211
// This command moves the current branch to commit 3923211, discarding all changes and commits after it permanently. This action cannot be undone unless backed up(Don't use this command if commit is pushed on GitHub)

// git reset --soft 3923211
// This command moves the current branch to commit 3923211 but keeps all changes from later commits staged, allowing you to modify or recommit them(Don't use this command if commit is pushed on GitHub)

// git reflog
// This command shows a history of all recent actions (commits, resets, checkouts, etc.) in the repository, even those that are not part of the commit history, helping to recover lost commits.

// git checkout HEAD
// This command switches to the latest commit of the current branch, discarding any uncommitted changes in tracked files

// git checkout HEAD~1(Number of commit behind Head)
// This command switches to the commit just before the latest commit (one commit behind HEAD), putting the repository in a detached HEAD state.
